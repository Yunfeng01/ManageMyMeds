Coding Standard: 

The coding standard for our project is derived from Apple's Coding Guidelines for Cocoa.



General Naming Conventions:

- Use a clear and easy to read naming style, keeping
  complicated abbreviations to a minimum.

-All names should be as self-explanatory as possible 
 e.g. removeObjectAtIndex is better than removeObject

-Use names consistently throughout code.



Class Names:

- Classes and their .m and .h files should be named in 
  CamelCase with the first letter of every word (including
  the first letter of the whole name) capitalized.
  e.g. ReminderDataController.h and ReminderDataController.m



Method Names:

- Method names should be specified in CamelCase
  with the first letter of the first word of the name 
  in lower case.
  e.g - (void)removeObjectFromListAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index;



Properties and Instance Variables:

-Properties and instance variables should be specified in CamelCase
 with the first letter of the first word of the name in lower case
 e.g. @property (nonatomic, copy) NSMutableArray *masterReminderList; 

   

Constants:

-Constants should be named in all uppercase letters with 
 a underscore between words in the name
 e.g. #define PICKER_MIN 1
